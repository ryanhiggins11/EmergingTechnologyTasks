# Tasks 2020.
This is my solutions to the tasks gave to me by IanMcLoughlynn to be completed as part of my Emerging Technologies module. Email (G00337350@gmit.ie)

## About this Assessment
For this assesment we were given 4 tasks each task was realesed on a particular date. The tasks are coded in python using Jupyter Notebook.

## To Run this Project
1) Git clone the repository
2) Enter into the specific folder
3) Type Jupyter Notebook which will in turn start jupyter notebook on your Computer.

## Overview/Brief Description of Tasks Completed
### Task 1
The task was to write a function called sqrt2 that calculates the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. The code should
not depend on any module from the standard library1 or otherwise. All research and referencing will be in my notebook.

### Task 2
The second task was based on the Chi Squared test for independence. The task was to use the scipy.stats to confirm that the Chi-Squared value of 24.6
was correct.  All research and referencing will be in my notebook.

### Task 3
The third task was to research the two excel functions STDEV.P and STDEV.S. Then we had to use numpy to perform a simulation
demonstrating that the STDEV.S calculation is a better estimate for the standard
deviation of a population when performed on a sample.  All research and referencing will be in my notebook.

### Task 4
We had to Use scikit-learn to apply k-means clustering to Fisherâ€™s famous Iris data set which could be found online. We then had to 
explain in a Markdown cell how your code works and how accurate it might be,
and then explain how your model could be used to make predictions of species of iris.  All research and referencing will be in my notebook.
